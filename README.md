This project was commissioned by the Space Systems Engineering and Operations course of my Master's program in Space Engineering.
The goal of this project was to study through reverse engineering all of the subsystems of a spacecraft critical for a correct functioning of the spacecraft. In particular our group had tostudy the OSTM/Jason-2 mission in it's entirety, with singular reports on each subsystem and a total document which collected all the information and data together.
